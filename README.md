## About
Lunch Time is an easy to use, multipurpose bot that aims to bring outside functions into Discord through the use of slash commands.
For example: instead of opening Google and searching up 'How far are we into the year?' then finding a website, just type /yearprogress and you'll get the same result quicker.
